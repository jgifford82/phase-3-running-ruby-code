# app.rb

# put ruby app.rb in the terminal to print output

# both of these do the same thing. parentheses are optional. 1st syntax is preferred for looks
puts "Hello World!"
# puts("Hello world!")

# puts and print will do almost the same thing, but puts includes a line break at end of string
# print "Hello world!"
# print "Hello world!"
# print "Hello world!"

# this prints a string
# puts [1, 2, 3]

# this prints an array
p [1, 2, 3]

# use pp to print complex data in a nice view
# pp [{ id: 1, hello: "World" }, { id: 2, hello: "Ruby" }, { id: 3, hello: "Moon" }, { id: 4, hello: "Learner" }]

print "Pass this test, please."
